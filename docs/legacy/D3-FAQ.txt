 =========================
  [1] General Information
 =========================


 [1.1] What is Descent 3 (henceforth called D3)?
 -----------------------------------------------

 D3 is the third title in the Descent series, the line of award-
 winning computer games created by Outrage Entertainment (former 
 Parallax Software). Like it's predecessors, D3 is an intense action-
 oriented game set in a 3D environment which received rave reviews 
 around the planet. 


 [1.2] Why didn't Parallax Software develop D3?
 ----------------------------------------------

 Although it may not appear to be so, Parallax Software DID produce D3 
 - or rather, one half of it. Parallax Software, when originally  
 formed in 1993, had people in two locations (Ann Arbor, Michigan and 
 Champaign, Illinois). 

 For Descent, work was done in Champaign while the company searched 
 for a mutual central location. After failing to find one, it was  
 decided to reorganize Parallax into two companies, Outrage (Ann 
 Arbor) and Volition Inc.  (Champaign). Both companies still maintain 
 strong links to each other.


 [1.3] Wasn't Descent: Freespace supposed to be D3?
 --------------------------------------------------

 No! Volition Inc. planned to release their new space-flightsim-combat-
 game under the name Freespace but a disk compression utility had the 
 name already registered in North America.
 
 So Volition changed the name to Descent: Freespace which has been 
 altered to Conflict: Freespace in Europe since Descent  
 (incomprehensibly enough) did not sell so well in Europe.


 [1.4] Do I need a 3d accelerator like Voodoo?
 ---------------------------------------------
  
 As minimum requirements state, you will need a Direct3D compatible 
 3D accelerator with at least 4 MB of onboard memory. In other words, 
 you'll need a 3D accelerator card, and a fairly good one too - a  
 Voodoo card is a good place to start, and was the target accelerator 
 for D3. 
 
 However, you do not need a Voodoo card if you already have a 3D 
 accelerator that meets the minimum system requirements (i.e. a  
 Riva128 video card). Other 3D accelerators such as the RivaTNT/Geforce
 and such also work fine with D3 as they are Direct3D compatible. 
 
 D3 supports Direct3D, OpenGL, and Glide APIs (Glide is a 3Dfx-
 specific API, so if you have a Voodoo you'd probably use that).  
 

 [1.5] Is a D3 demo available?
 -----------------------------
 
 Yes, there are even two of them which are approx. 35 MB each (MAC: 
 one demo of approx. 48 MB). 

 Demo 1 features level 3, Piccu Station of the full version plus 2 
 multiplayer levels, The Core (2-8 players) and Polaris (16+ players). 
 Demo 2 features level 1, Deimos of the retail version, both multi- 
 player levels of Demo 1 plus an additional very cool multiplayer 
 level called Taurus (4-16 players). 
 
 It's your decision which to try out. You can get them from the 
 following locations:

 PC
 http://descent-3.com/shareware/d3/
 http://www.outrage.com/4_downloads.html#d3_demos
 http://www.interplay.com/descent3/fdemos.html

 MAC
 http://www.imgmagazine.com/downloads/demos/99/descent3/
 
 
 [1.6] What is D3 Sol Ascent?
 ----------------------------

 D3 Sol Ascent is an OEM version (i.e. commercial version, no demo) of
 the D3 retail. It features levels 1-5 of the retail version whereas 
 level 1: Deimos is also available for download as D3 Demo 2 and  
 level 3: Piccu Station as D3 Demo 1. Sol Ascent also covers the multi-
 player levels of both D3 demos: The Core, Polaris & Taurus. However, 
 this OEM-version version is only available bundled with Voodoo 3 
 (3000 not 2000!) boards and does *not* run on other boards!

 There've been some unconfirmed rumours that this version has been 
 bundled with other hardware recently which would indicate that you  
 could run it on other graphics boards as well. However, I personally 
 doubt it and if you're interested in playtesting the game I'd still 
 recommend the demos since Sol Ascent is very buggy and Outrage will 
 not release any patches for it.


 [1.7] What is D3 Mercenary?
 ---------------------------

 Mercenary is an offical addon to D3 from the Outrage developers 
 themselves. It features 7 gigantic single-player levels and a bunch 
 of really weird  multiplayer levels. As well you pilot a new ship:  
 the Black Pyro which fires 2 missiles at once but can't fire  
 secondaries when there's only 1 missile (of Concs, Homing or  
 Cyclone) left. As well it features a different storyline, this 
 time your a Mercenary that's working for Dravis.

 Some people complained about this one as a cheap ripoff with not 
 enough new features but I must say that levels 3 and 4 are the 
 coolest Descent levels I've ever played.


 [1.8] Will there be a Mac/Linux/etc. port?
 ------------------------------------------

 Yes, the Mac port has been released already and you can download a 
 Linux dedicated server. As well, it's definite that there will be a  
 Linux client! It's not sure when it will be released though.

 Get the Linux server here: http://www.outrage.com/4_downloads.html.


 [1.9] Is there a demo recording system in D3?
 ---------------------------------------------

 Yes! D3 has a new demo recording system, so you can continue to watch
 the exploits of your friends blasting robots (or yourself blasting 
 your friends or yourself getting blasted by your friends) into  
 oblivion. However, due to the way the system works it's recommended 
 to record and playback the demo on the same framerate. Otherwise 
 you'd get really weird results, e.g. a demo  recorded on 30 fps 
 (frames per second) and played back on 90 fps would look as if 
 someone would hold down the fast forward key.

 A good compromise would be to record the demo on 50 fps which should
 be achievable on any system that is capable of making D3 run at an 
 acceptable speed; as well the demo does not get too large  
 (nevertheless always zip it before sending it to someone!). This is 
 the default fps setting so you do not have to change anything unless 
 you didn't fiddled with the framecap parameter (which in that case 
 would have to be adjusted as explained in section [3.8]).


 ======================
  [2] Troubleshooting
 ======================

 [2.1] Starting the game brings up the message "Sorry, your computer 
 ----- has a language not supported by this version of Descent 3" 
       and the game stops. 
 
 
 Update the game to the latest patch, this will remove the language 
 check.


 [2.2] How can I check my framerate?
 -----------------------------------

 D3 allows a few options for checking and testing performance.

 While in the game to see a real time framerate meter simply type 
 "frametime" or "framelength" (without the quotes). A framerate meter  
 will appear in the upper left corner of the screen (reenter to turn 
 it off).

 To test your system's performance and framerate against other systems
 a command line option (see section [3.8] on where to add them) is  
 available for use.
 
 The -timetest <filename.dem> command allows D3 to run through a pre-
 recorded  demo file, and places the full results in the D3 directory 
 in a file called fps.txt. In the command line box enter
 
 -timetest <filename>.dem  (don't forget the hyphen!)

 <filename> is any valid demo file. D3 includes a demo file called 
 secret2.dem. This file does not include any outdoor areas, but  
 serves as a basic test. For example, in the command line enter

 -timetest secret2.dem -framecap 999  

 Then click the 'OK' button, and  click 'Play'. It is important to 
 include the -framecap 999 command. If this is not done the demo will 
 run at the maximum default framecap of 50fps.
 
 D3 will run the demo and create the file fps.txt.

 For a more advanced and complex standard file which includes some 
 outdoor areas, and is likely a better indicator of performance, 
 check the D3 performance tests site http://www.descent-3.com/support/
 fpstest.


 [2.3] How do I know which Video API or Sound mixer to use?
 ----------------------------------------------------------

 Always try to use the best video API and sound mixer for your system.
 This will vary depending on the amount of RAM, speed of the CPU, the 
 type of video card, and sound card in the system.

 If the 3D game card is from the 3DFX Voodoo line then Glide (Voodoo 
 family) will always offer the best performance. Other video cards  
 that don't support Glide normally support a minimum of Direct3D (as 
 a subset of Direct X). Some cards may also support OpenGl. In 
 general Direct3D will work the best although some people find better 
 performance using OpenGl. This varies from card to card, and even 
 between driver revisions. The choice of which graphics API the game 
 will use is found in the setup menu under the video tab.

 Choose a graphics detail level in the game that makes sense. If you 
 are running D3 on a Pentium 233, don't expect good performance at a 
 high resolution with high detail. Choose an appropriate resolution 
 for the game.

 D3 also offers a variety of 'sound mixers'. These are found in the 
 setup menu under the audio tab. The mixer types supported are:

 Software Mixer: This is generally the best choice for performance. It
 mixes the sound internally and passes the mixed sounds to the sound 
 card.

 Direct Sound: This is another common choice, and in some case will 
 improve performance if the system does not have enough RAM. In this  
 case the sounds are sent individually and the sound card mixes them.  
 This reduces the required RAM and reduces the CPU load slightly, but 
 will cause more transactions on the bus to the sound card.

 Direct Sound 3D: This is the Direct X version of 3D sound. If the 
 card supports the feature it offers a slightly more 3D effect. It  
 will also require more CPU power. On a lower end system this is not a 
 good choice.

 Aureal 3D Sound: This is Aureal's proprietary 3D sound. If you have a
 sound card that supports the feature it offers a fairly good 3D sound 
 effect. It will however use the most CPU overhead of any of the  
 mixers. If you choose this option, please visit Aureal's web site and 
 get the latest drivers. They have reduced CPU overhead quite a bit.

 Creative EAX: This is Creative labs proprietary 3D sound. It also 
 offers fairly good 3D sound. It requires less CPU overhead than the 
 Aureal, but is still power hungry.

 In general most systems will find that either the software mixer or 
 the Direct sound will offer the best performance. The different 3D 
 sound mixers offer a slighly more interesting experience, but at a 
 cost. Unless you have a powerful system stick with a basic mixer.


 [2.4] My framerate gets choppy when there is a lot of action, 
 ----- what can I do?
 

 Make sure all the video and sound card driver are up to date.  

 If you find that during game play, and heavy battles the video and/or
 sound get choppy or slows down, make sure you are using either the 
 Software or Direct sound mixer. Also you may consider adding more 
 RAM.

 Try reducing screen resolution to 640 x 480, or even 512 x 384. 
 Disable some of the 'eye candy' in the details menu.

 Try using the command line options -lowmem or -superlowmem. These can
 be very helpful if the system doesn't have much RAM. As a rule of 
 thumb a realistic minimum system is a 333MHz cpu with 64megs of RAM, 
 and a Voodoo 2 or TNT card. For truly good performace a 500MHz+ CPU, 
 128 megs of RAM, and a Voodoo 3 or TNT2 is a good starting point.


 [2.5] My framerate is always 50 fps, I hear others say they have 
 ----- over 100?
 
 D3 has a default framerate cap of 50 fps. This is done to help 
 slower computers maintain a more constant framerate during play. In 
 short, by only trying to render a maximum of 50 fps more power is  
 left for each frame.

 If you have a powerful system you can uncap the framerate, or you 
 may want to alter the maximum framecap. For example on a low end 
 system you may want to use 30. A high end system maybe 100, or have 
 removed the cap altogether.

 The framecap is controlled with the -framecap xxx command. Where xxx 
 is the desired cap. For example  -framecap 30, or -framcap 80. If the
 number used is 999, the framecap is removed altogether (see section  
 [3.8] on how to enter these).

 Many players also find that the video seems smoother if Vsync is 
 disabled in the video options of the main menu.


 [2.6] I can't see through transparent windows with my ATI Rage Pro 
 ----- Turbo AGP!
  
 This is a known bug with some ATI Rage Pro Turbo AGP graphic boards 
 (and even some others) which is related to the board's drivers.  
 Since the 1.1 patch Outrage used a workaround: add the command line 
 switch -NoRenderWindows (as explained in section [3.8]) which makes 
 those windows become fully transparent.


 [2.7] D3 hangs whenever I ALT-TAB out of the game into Windows on my 
 ----- Voodoo 3! 
 
 This is a bug in the Voodoo drivers, update to the latest drivers! 
 However, in some cases and system configurations this may still be a 
 problem.


 [2.8] What is the best configuration for my modem?
 --------------------------------------------------

 Always set the modem correctly according to the type you have. Trying
 to force more packets per second than the modem can handle will never 
 help.

 Insure that any modem drivers are up to date. Insure that the modem 
 is properly configured for windows. Note: See the following section 
 for possible modem configuration and tips.


 [2.9] What can I do to improve my modem connection?
 ---------------------------------------------------

 There are a number of different types and brands of analog dial in 
 modems. Many computers come with 'software' modems such as the 
 USRobtics Winmodem. Many if not most other brands offer a software 
 modem of some kind. They are not a good choice for gaming.

 Basically they depend on the computer to handle many of the modem 
 tasks in  software rather than having dedicated hardware for the 
 purpose. They are less expensive than a hardware based modem, but 
 tend to have higher loss, and higher pings. A hardware based modem is 
 always better. In many cases it will shave 100ms off ping times. The 
 preferred modem is the USRobotics Sportster or their new Gaming 
 modem. 

 A digital connection is of course the best: ISDN, xDSL, or a cable 
 modem.

 If you have an analog modem, there are some things that you can try 
 to improve gameplay. Some of the suggestions may seem contrary to 
 what you might think, but prove true for many players, especially if 
 using a software based modem. There are certain settings that can be 
 found in the windows control panel under the modem icon.

 In Win98 for example, but similar in all win9x version:
   - Select the modem
   - Select Properties
   - Set the 'Maximum speed' to 57600 rather than 115200
     (this is the speed the computer talks to the modem, not the 
      connection speed of the modem)

   - Select the connection Tab
   - Click 'Port settings'
   - Set the Transmit Buffer FIFO to 3/4 setting rather than the 
     default FULL (both Rx/Tx should be at 3/4)
   - Click OK

   - Click the 'Advanced' Button 
   - In the upper left area is a check box for 'Compress data' 
   - In most cases games will play best with this disabled, you need 
     to test  both ways, default is enabled. Enabled is clearly      
     better for downloading and web browsing. In the case of games,
     sending a lot of small packets it will tend to be smoother play
     if it is disabled.


 [2.10] My in-game loss meter shows loss like 100% sometimes!
 ------------------------------------------------------------

 The in game loss meter is an indicator, and nothing more. Due to the
 method used it will sometimes give an inaccurate number. These seem 
 to be a few specific numbers. So if from time to time the loss is 
 reported as one of the following percentages it is likely a false 
 indicator.

 11%, 14%, 25% 33%, 50%, 66%, 75%, 83% 100%. There may be a few 
 others, but these are known. It is also a clear indication when you 
 see for example 0% loss, then 100%, then 0% most of the time, that  
 the 100% loss is false. If the loss was accurate you would notice 
 that all other players 'floated' during the prior 3 seconds, that you 
 were unable to gather powerups, etc.

 The way D3 determines the loss, is that over a 3 second period the 
 client keeps track of how many packets/bytes it received. At the end 
 of that 3 second period the server will send a packet telling the  
 client how many packets/bytes were actually sent. The client  
 determines the loss and then displays the percentage of loss from 
 that period until the next 3 second sample replaces it. 

 True loss will tend to have a much greater variety of percentage 
 displayed and be more constant. For example if the diplay shows 8%, 
 then 3% then 12%, etc. it is likely true loss.


 [2.11] Help, I can't start Mercenary: 'redbuddybot.oof not found'!
 ------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 There seem to be a variety of problems with installing Mercenary
 for some people. In some cases it will install fine. In others
 it will install but generate an error when you attempt to run it.

 Two possible solutions:

 1) Uninstall Descent 3, you can save your pilot files and such.
 Then do a clean install of Descent 3 version 1.0 from the CD's.
 Start the game and configure the video, audio and other options.
 Then install Mercenary. This will work for many.

 2) If the first option does not work try a clean 1.0 installation 
 of D3, and patch the game to at least 1.2. Configure the 
 setup in the D3 launcher and after that install Mercenary over it 
 which patches the game to 1.3 in the process (unless you hadn't 
 already started from 1.3 certainly).
 

 [2.12] I have a joystick that isn't working too well.
 -----------------------------------------------------
 
 Make sure you have it configured and calibrated properly in the control
 panel. Some sticks have various driver settings and there are older
 and newer sticks that respond differently to the operating system so
 sometimes tweaks are in order. If your stick isn't working, adding
 the -alternatejoy command line argument is the first place to look.
 
 Some sticks like the Cyborg 3d require some extra configuration in
 the setup of profiles for the stick. In the command center, set
 up your keyboard settings for Descent 3, and setup the utilites to
 reference descent3.sai when they are starting.

 [3.1] What ships are available in D3?
 ------------------------------------- 

 There are 4 ships in total in D3 whereas the Black Pyro is only available to 
 owners of the Mercenary addon. In the single-player storyline you start out 
 with the Pyro-GL, a modified version of the Pyro-GX of Descent 1/2. It 
 performs much like the old ship.

 
 The second ship available is the Phoenix that you got to find at the end of 
 level 6 and start to use in level 7. The third ship is the Magnum-AHT, which 
 enters the single-player storyline in level 9 and can be used in level 10 for 
 the first time. 
 
 Once you've played the game through you can choose whatever ship you like on
 starting a new game (also see section [5.12]).
 
 
 [3.2] What about the Guidebot and it's objectives?
 --------------------------------------------------
 
 Contrary to it's predecessors D3 develops a storyline as you advance 
 through the levels. In the briefing at the beginning of each level 
 you're given a short overview on what has to be done to advance to  
 the next level. Your mission is split into several objectives that 
 can be reviewed in-game by using your TelCom-system (SHIFT+TAB).
 
 In addition you got to use the Guidebot which now has a far larger 
 influence on your way of completing the game. It always knows what 
 to do next to fulfill the current objective. If you're not sure what 
 to do next, take a look at the first command on the GB's menu; it 
 will show you how to go on.


 [3.3] What's this 'use item' feature I heard about?
 ---------------------------------------------------

 Unlike to D1/D2 you now have to use some items (keys and stuff) 
 explicitely by pressing the 'use item'-key. When you run over a key 
 or a data cartridge it's automatically placed into your inventory 
 and you can cycle through these items. The default keys for 'use 
 item' and 'cycle item' depend on the language version your're 
 playing so check your config.

 Additionally you should enable the inventory listing in the HUD 
 settings, so you can see whether the item you need is currently 
 selected; if it's not just cycle through the items you've picked up. 


 [3.4] What's this mouselook feature I noticed some discussion about? 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------

 As with Quake you are now able to use the mouse to make the ship 
 face any direction your pointing the mouse at immediately. This gives 
 mouselookers a certain advantage since they can turn and aim faster 
 than you could usually in Descent. As well you need less skill to 
 control your ship which is one reason why this feature has been 
 widely regarded as a bad move.

 However, it is turned off by default so you don't have to worry about 
 it  whenever you host a multiplayer game.

 
 [3.5] What's a so-called 'X-Factor' that's been introduced with D3?
 -------------------------------------------------------------------

 It's a feature of the advanced AI that's been developed for D3. Every 
 robot has a certain kind of behaviour/attribute about it; eg. the 
 Barnswallow collects powerups and puts them into it's net, the Orbot 
 is highly inflammable... Summed up: the AI is frightening realistic.  

 
 [3.6] How do countermeasures work?
 ----------------------------------

 Countermeasures add a third weapons tier to D3. Instead of lumping 
 the dropped  weapons (e.g. proximity bombs) in with the secondary 
 weapons, they have been grouped into their own new category. As with 
 the 'use item'-feature (also see section [3.3]) you need to define 
 certain keys for using and cycling  countermeasures (check your 
 config).


 [3.7] What are the new weapons in D3?
 -------------------------------------

 primary
 =======

 Vauss Cannon
 A dual-fire machine gun in the tradition of the Vulcan and Gauss 
 Cannons. It's weaker than the Gauss, but stronger than the Vulcan.

 Napalm Cannon
 Your standard flamethrower. Burn baby, burn!

 Microwave Cannon
 Deforms the viewpoint of anything it hits, including players (cool 
 effect!). 

 EMD Gun
 Arcing electro-magnetic energy at your enemy like a homing weapon but 
 without causing the typical alert sound. They never know what hit 
 them.

 Mass Driver
 The perfect sniper weapon. It's telescopic range finder zooms in on 
 your enemy to make you place the perfect shot. Calculate some reload 
 time though.


 secondary
 =========

 Napalm Missile
 Ejects Napalm upon impact and burns for ten seconds while dripping 
 down onto the ground. Good for ambushes in tunnels. 

 Frag Missile
 Much like the Smart Missile, the Frag Missile releases shrapnel upon
 impact but the smaller shrapnels do not home in on your target. 
 Nevertheless very useful to seal some tube when enemies follow close 
 behind. 
 
 Cyclone Missile
 Seperates in-flight into six smaller homing missiles from the main 
 missile body. You'll need some distance to your target though.

 Impact Mortar  Needs quite some timing due to it's comparatively slow 
 travelling speed. Once released it'll go straight ahead and detonate 
 in a huge explosion with a large blast radius after approx. 3 
 seconds.

 Blackshark Missile
 Keep quite some distance to your target since this missile creates a 
 whirling maelstrom upon impact dragging everything in close range 
 into it before the explosion of a dying star shredds the victims to 
 bits.
 
 
 countermeasures
 ===============

 Bouncing Betty
 A pack of bouncing bomb which are difficult to avoid.

 Seeker Mines
 A mine that will seek out players, comparatively slow but dangerous 
 in numbers. 

 Gunboy
 Floating turret bomb. Not actually powerful but very distracting 
 which gives you some extra moments to finish off your target. As 
 well very useful as an alarm system in multiplayer games that  
 notifies you of your opponent's position in the mine. 

 Chaff Burst
 Doesn't do any damage but attracts homing missiles so you better have
 some handy.


 [3.8] Where can I enter command-line parameters?
 ------------------------------------------------
 
 Open the D3 launcher and select setup | misc | optional D3 command line  
 switches and add them with one blank space in between e.g. 
 -framecap30 -nomovie (don't forget the hyphen).
 
 
 [3.9] How can I skip the intro movie?
 -------------------------------------
 
 Add the line -nointro to the command-line parameters (see above).
 
 
 [3.10] What are wind tunnels?
 -----------------------------
 
 These are cool one-way tubes that catapult your ship from one end to the other 
 very fast. Actually they are rather fun to ride especially in Mercenary level  
 3 or the Multiplayer level Taurus. Some people also refer to them as gravity 
 tubes. View the secret2.dem that gets installed with D3 to see what it feels  
 like.
 
 In single play you should get the Guidebot back into your ship before you use 
 them since you don't know wether you'll be able to get back to pick him up.
 
 
 [3.11] What's wrong with the new automap?
 -----------------------------------------
 
 Well, everyone would agree that the new autompap looks terrribly 
 cool! 
 
 Unfortunately it does not color unvisited parts of the mines 
 differently when you've picked up the full map powerup! Instead 
 you'll be shown the whole map in it's normal colors. Thus to prevent 
 losing orientation avoid the full map so you can recognize unvisited 
 rooms by a blinking portal (= connection between two rooms).

 Curiously enough secret areas do not show up on the (full) map unless
 you have visited them. Till then you'll only see a black portal  
 indicating that something will be behind.



 ===================
  [4] Single-Player 
 ===================


 Following are brief answers to some scenes most single-players seem
 to have problems with. In case you need more thorough help like 
 walkthroughs, map screenshots and how-to demos (or help on things 
 not mentioned below) please visit http://www.gamesdomain.co.uk/
 moonglow/.


 [4.1] What are the cheat codes and how do I activate them?
 ----------------------------------------------------------

 Simply enter any of the following cheat codes during the game (i.e. 
 wherever you are in a level) but note that your shields and energy 
 will get reduced to zero. This also happens when you use codes from 
 the predecessors (after all this is not ID Software!).

 Note: these codes do NOT work in multiplayer! The codes are not case 
 sensitive  and you only need to type in the last 8 characters, the 
 full names listed below are easier to remember though. German players 
 please note that 'Z' is 'Y' and vice versa.

 The codes followed by an asterisk (*) are no cheat codes in the usual
 sense so they do not reduce your shields/energy and some of them do   
 work in multiplay.


 all versions (*):
   
     Frametime:       displays the Frames per second (FPS) - reenter 
                      to turn off

     Testicus:        Cloaking Device
     TreeSquid:       full map 
     Tuberacer:       210 damage (ouch!)


 [4.2] How many (secret) levels does D3 feature? 
 -----------------------------------------------

 15 levels + 2 secret levels. This may not sound very impressive 
 compared to D1/D2 but please note that the D3 levels are about 3-4 
 times larger!


 [4.3] Are there any teleports and if not, how do I get to the secret
 ----- levels?
  
 There aren't any teleports (except in Mercenary level 4). To reach a
 secret level you got to find a hidden data cartridge in levels 8 and 
 12. Once you picked it up and fisnished the level the usual way (by 
 completing all primary objectives) you'll come out in the secret 
 level.


 [4.4] How do I free Dr. Sweitzer in level 2?
 --------------------------------------------

 You've got to create a diversion to make him get shifted to a lower 
 security level where he can be picked up by the shuttle.
 
 After having gained entrance to the higher security levels by the 
 using (see section [3.3]) several keys, let the GB lead you to the 
 Maintenance Gate. Shoot the grate to enter the service tunnel and 
 use the right way till you come into a room with an acid vat. Try 
 the levers, read the signs and you'll get the point.


 [4.5] Help, I can't enter Dr. Sweitzer's lab in level 3.
 --------------------------------------------------------

 As said in the manual: use Vauss or missiles to destroy windows(!).


 [4.6] Those level 4 trains keep shredding me to bits, any hints?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------

 Each train has a certain pattern you got to memorize. Watch the 
 trains till you find the gap and afterburn to the next intermission. 
 Keep checking the map so you can see which direction to go to.


 [4.7] I'm not worthy to get the Priest's Icon on level 6!
 ---------------------------------------------------------

 Watch the floor or ceiling (turn on your headlight) for visual clues
 that show you the right path. Note that you'll need to pass one  
 square twice in different directions.


 [4.8] I can't escape the firetrap at the beginning of level 12.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------

 Shoot each tong as soon as it opens. After that shoot the forcefields
 with your Laser in such an angle that the reflected shots hit the 
 generators on both sides of your ship (as you could see in the short 
 cutscene at the beginning of this level).


 [4.9] How do I disable the Aft Matcen/where are the Stormtroopers in
 ----- level 13?
 
 Shoot a Frag or Guided Missile down the shaft to hit the trigger 
 inside (as seen in the cutscene at the beginning of this level).
 
 The Stormtroopers are spread over the level and cannot be looked for 
 by the Guidebot. Thus you should let the GB look for robots or 
 powerups so he will lead you into parts of the level you haven't 
 visited before. Do NOT pickup the full map as explained in section 
 [3.11].
 
 You should take the Aft Matcen as the first objective since it's 
 deactivation stops the production of further Stormtroopers. It's 
 also quite good to visit the engine surge chamber early!


 [4.10] Where's the trigger to activate the beam emitter in level 14?
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Again the logs will help you out here: "I searched for an hour before
 somebody said, 'just remember who you work for'". You do now work for 
 the CED so the hidden trigger must be (and is) the small CED sign 
 under the generators in the large room where you placed the lens.

 Instead of shooting it simply bump into it with your ship and the 
 beam gets activated.


 [4.11] Where is the key to Dravis' stronghold in level 15?
 ----------------------------------------------------------

 Left of the hall with the large lave tanks there's a control room 
 with three wheels. Shoot the left one to drain the left lava pool and 
 rush inside through the door at the ground of it. On the inside above 
 the door you just emerged from is the trigger to open the room on 
 the opposite side with the key.


 [4.12] How can I disable the primary cooling fan in Mercenary lvl 3?
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Use the same technique as with the harzardous storage forcefield: 
 place yourself as close as possible to the first forcefield and 
 shoot the middle of it. With a bit of luck the shots bounce off the 
 other forcefields and destroy the generator at the end of the 
 tunnel.


 [4.13] What about the Manual Pilot Powerup for the Guidebot?
 ------------------------------------------------------------

 Actually this is already to be found in the original D3 Retribution 
 HOG but it has not been used in any of these levels. As well, the 
 occurance in Mercenary level 4 seems to be a bug since the use of 
 it does not have any effect. Presumably the scripting routines just 
 weren't finished in time and someone accidently placed this powerup 
 instead of a working one in Mercenary level 4.

 Anyway, here's how to get it: there's one room with four large 
 pillars that connects three levels of the planetoid. Fly up to the 
 top level and then go straight ahead through the middle tunnel and  
 over a small pond. Pass an insectoid generator to your left and shoot
 the second 'mirror forcefield' on the left side. In the room behind 
 you'll find the 'new' GB powerup (which has some striking similarity 
 to a joystick <g>) as well as an invaluable energy to shield  
 converter.
  
 
 [4.14] I heard you could meet Jeff Slutter & Nate Goudie in Mercenary
 ------ level 4?
 
 Well yes, but they are hard to find! Exit the honeycomb mentioned 
 above and take a close look at the texures on the opposite wall. 
 There's a flythrough texture you should examine to give both of them 
 a yell ;)


 [4.15] Help, I keep getting smacked by an invisible force in Sol  
 ------ Ascent level 3! 
 
 This is the bug as confirmed by some of the programmers. Sometimes 
 you'll encounter those dudes which suddenly can become visible which 
 is the only time where you can shoot and hit them. When they are 
 invisble you can't hit them at all even if you know where they are. 
 You can only keep moving to stay alive. As said before there will be 
 no patch to fix this.


 
 =================
  [5] Multiplayer
 =================


 [5.1] What network protocols are supported?
 -------------------------------------------

 D3 supports a variety of protocols and online services: TCP/IP, IPX, 
 Direct Serial, Modem to Modem, PXO, and HEAT.

 PXO is a free service provided by Outrage which allows you start or 
 join existing games online via virtually any internet connection. A 
 chat interface is provided. You will find a large variety of  
 dedicated servers and games variations.

 HEAT.NET provides another online gaming service with Dedicated 
 servers on demand (DOD). It does however not support third party  
 levels at this time.

 TCP/IP is supported for LAN and Direct Internet play.

 IPX is provided for LAN as well as Internet play with the use of 
 programs such as Kali and Kahn.
 
 Modem to Modem play is available for 2 player games via direct modem 
 to modem connections.

 Direct serial may be used to connect two computers with a simple 
 serial cable.
 

 [5.2] Are dedicated servers required for multiplayer games?
 -----------------------------------------------------------

 No, a dedicated server is not required though it will provide the 
 best game play. D3 allows games to be hosted so that for small games 
 a player may start (host) a game. It is always best in this case to 
 have the player with the best connection (most bandwidth) host the 
 game.

 Also see the section [5.14] referring to lag and loss and section [6]   
 referring to setting up dedicated servers.


 [5.3] What is the maximum number of players D3 can support?
 -----------------------------------------------------------
 
 D3 can support a maximum of 32 players. In the case of a dedicated
 server, the server itself counts as one player. So only 31 actual 
 clients may join the game. In a hosted game, since the host is also 
 a client, it is possible to actually have 32 players. Keep in mind 
 this would require a very powerful computer to handle the client as 
 well as manage a 32 player server.


 [5.4] What Network Architecture does D3 use?
 --------------------------------------------

 D3 is based around a Client/Server architecture. This means there is
 always a server of some kind, whether a dedicated server or a listen 
 server. A listen server is a hosted game, where the client is  
 running on top of the server on a single computer. D3 offers a 
 number of variations.

 A Dedicated C/S game is one where a computer acts as a dedicated  
 server for all  clients. The server is used to determine the action 
 of the game, such as whether a shot hit another client, a door  
 opened, etc. In simple terms, this model will offer the best game 
 play. Since the client talks to the server rather than the other 
 players, a player's ping (lag) is constant to all other players.

 A Hosted C/S (a listen server) acts the same as a dedicated server.
 The main difference being that the computer hosting the game will 
 have zero ping to the server. On a LAN (Local Area Network) this is 
 not important. In an online game this can offer a substantial 
 advantage to the Hosting Client. The ping or lag to all other players 
 will be constant as with a dedicated server.

 A Permissible C/S server model is also available. It may be used 
 with either a dedicated server or a hosted C/S game. It is the same 
 as the C/S models in every way with one exception: the shots are 
 sent in a permissible fashion. This means that when you fire a 
 weapon the shot is delayed by the amount of lag between you and the 
 server. The obvious disadvantage is that in games with much lag it 
 can be very difficult to deal with. The advantage is that if you 
 see a shot hit a target, you are certain it did hit. This is not a 
 good choice for most online games, but may be a good option in LAN 
 games.

 A Peer to Peer game is a combination of two architectures. The person 
 who starts the game acts as a host, or server but position and fire 
 packets are sent directly between clients. In this model, clients 
 also determine locally whether they were hit by incoming weapons. The 
 host or server keeps track of powerups, level events such as doors, 
 and actual damage and deaths. The ping to each player will vary, 
 much as the true peer to peer model of Descent 1 and 2. All players 
 other than the host will also experience some lag when picking up 
 powerups, opening doors, etc.

 A Dedicated Peer to Peer has basically the same characteristics as a 
 simple Peer to Peer game. The only difference being that the server 
 functions are provided by a dedicated computer rather than a hosting 
 client.


 [5.5] What is the minimum connection or modem required for play?
 ----------------------------------------------------------------

 D3 requires a minimum of a 28.8 analog modem. Basically, the faster 
 the better. A high speed connect such as ISDN, xDSL, or Cable modem 
 will make the game much more enjoyable.


 [5.6] What Multiplayer modes are available?
 -------------------------------------------

 Out of the box D3 supports a number of types of Multiplayer.

 - Anarchy:          A free for all kill fest. Each player for 
                     themself.
 - Team Anarchy:     Two teams compete against each other.
 - Hyper Anarchy:    A mode for advanced scoring if you possess the 
                     HyperOrb.
 - Robo Anarchy:     Similar to Anarchy with enemy Robots.
 - Hoard:            Hoards are collected after a kill, points are 
                     scored only by placing those orbs in a goal. 
                     The more orbs you place at once the more points 
                     you receive.
 - Capture the Flag: A team based game where points are scored by 
                     capturing the opponent's flag, and placing it in 
                     your goal.
 - Mosterball:       Points are scored by moving a 'Mosterball' with 
                     weapon's fire or even ship bumping into a goal.
 - Co-Op:            A mode where you work as a team with other 
                     players against the robots.


 [5.7] How do I chat in a game?
 ------------------------------

 To chat or send a message in a game, simply press the F8 key. Then 
 type your message and hit <enter>. While typing a 'keyboard' icon 
 will appear over your ship in the game to alert the other players you 
 are typing. It is considered bad form to shoot at or kill a player 
 who is typing although accidents happen ;)
 
 To send a private message in a game, you can enter the other player's
 (or team's) name followed by a colon (:) and then your message. That  
 message will be sent only to that player or team. It is only 
 necesary to enter enough of the  name to distinguish the player or 
 team. 

 For example: (if a player named Pilot is in the game)

 <F8> Pilot:This is a private message<enter> or
 <F8> Pi:This is a private message<enter>

 will work just as well as long as no other players have names 
 beginning with the letters Pi.


 [5.8] How do I use text taunts?
 -------------------------------

 D3 allows the use of eight preconfigured text taunt macros or 
 messages. While in the game, these can be sent to the other players 
 by pressing the 'Ctrl' key and a number key 1 through 8 (not those 
 on the numeric keypad).

 To configure or customize the macros, enter the pilot configuration 
 screen. This is done from the main menu of D3 by selecting The 
 'Pilots' menu. Then select the Pilot name you wish to configure 
 macros for, and click 'Configure' followed by clicking 'Ship  
 Configuration'. Then Click the 'Set Taunt Macros' button. At this 
 point simply enter the text for each macro you would like to 
 change. The top line is 'Ctrl 1' macro, the bottom the 'Ctrl 8'  
 macro.


 [5.9] How do I create and use audio taunts?
 -------------------------------------------

 D3 allows the use of up to four audio taunts. These can be created 
 with a simple tool like Windows Sound Recorder, or a variety of WAV 
 studio apps. The file MUST be recorded in the 8 Bit, Mono, 22KHz 
 format. Then it must be imported into D3 as a .OSF. In the process 
 of importing and converting to an .OSF file Descent 3 will attempt 
 to compress the sound file.
 
 After compression the resulting .OSF file must be no larger than 32 
 KBytes. In some cases it will seem to import and test correctly, but 
 other players will be unable to hear the taunts, even though you hear 
 them locally. This would indicate that the .OSF file is larger than 
 32 KBytes.

 To import a .WAV file go to main menu of D3 and select the 'Pilots' 
 menu. Then select the Pilot name you wish to add the audio taunt 
 file to, and click 'Configure' followed by clicking 'Ship 
 Configuration'. Then Click the 'Import Sound' button. In the box 
 that by default will read 'C:\Games\Descent3' enter the full path and 
 file name of the .WAV file. Then click 'Open'. D3 will import and 
 convert the file to the .OSF format used by D3.

 Then from on the lower left of the screen use the up and down arrows
 in each of the selection boxes named 'Audio Taunt #1 through #4'. 
 After selecting you can test the audio taunt by clicking the 'Play' 
 button next to it.

 Click the 'OK' button at the lower right to return to the prior menu.
 Then click the 'Configure Keyboard' or the 'Configure Controller' 
 button depending on which you would like to use to send the audio 
 taunts. In the lower left section of the screen assign a key or 
 controller button for each of the four audio taunts you wish to use. 

 You may also use taunts that have been imported/downloaded to your 
 system when you have joined games where they were used.


 [5.10] How do I create and use a ship Logo?
 -------------------------------------------

 D3 allows a custom logo to be shown on your ship's wing. The logo 
 can be created using a tool like Tycoon's Descent III logo editor 
 (see section [7.3]), or a program such as Photoshop or Paintshop 
 Pro. The logo must be a 64 x 64 pixel image in .TGA format. Once an 
 image is created, you will need to import it to D3, and configure it 
 for use. Several other file formats are also supported.

 Importing a logo is simple and straight forward. This is done from 
 the main menu of D3 by selecting The 'Pilots' menu. Then select the 
 Pilot name you wish to add the logo to, and click 'Configure' 
 followed by clicking 'Ship Configuration'. Then Click the 'Import 
 Graphic' button. In the box that by default will read 'c:\Games\
 Descent3' enter the full path and file name of the logo file. Then 
 click 'Open'. D3 will import and convert the file to the .OGF format 
 used by D3.

 Then from the 'Custom Textures' Menu in the upper left portion of the 
 screen simply select the logo. It will appear in the preview box. 
 You may also choose  a logo that has been imported to your graphics 
 directory (Descent3\custom\graphics). These are imported or down-
 loaded each time you join multiplayer game where logos are being 
 used.

 A number of web sites also offer a variety of logos.


 [5.11] How do I get my pilot picture to show like I see some pilots 
 ------ have?
 
 The Pilot pictures were done as a promotion prior to the release of 
 D3. It required that a picture was submitted to Interplay by a 
 certain date. There is no way to add new pictures, nor does Descent 
 3 have a method for transmitting them to other players.

 If your picture was submitted it may be selected in the pilot 
 configuration menu by using the 'Choose Pilot Picture' Button. The 
 pilot name must match the name of the picture. Otherwise an error 
 message will inform you that no pictures are available for that 
 pilot.


 [5.12] How do I select a ship and why can't I select the Black Pyro?
 --------------------------------------------------------------------

 Different ships may be selected in the pilot configuration menu, by
 clicking the 'Ship Configuration' button. In the upper left corner 
 the selection is made by using the up and down arrow keys in the 
 'Default Ship' selection box.

 There are 3 basic ships, and one special add on ship.

 Pyro-GL:    This ship offers a good balance of speed, weapons, and 
             maneuverability

 Phoenix:    This ship offers high speed and maneuverability, but can 
             carry less weapons, and has weaker shields.

 Magnum-AHT: This ship offers the highest weapons payload, and the 
             strongest shields as a trade-off for less speed and            
             maneuverability.

 Black Pyro: The Black Pyro is only available with the D3 Mercenary 
             addon pack. Much like the Pyro-GL in speed and payload. 
             It offers the ability to fire certain missiles in pairs, 
             as well as a version of the Plasma Cannon that pulses. 
             Besides you have a Microwave Cannon with three beams.


 [5.13] Why do my Custom\Graphics and Sound Directories have so many
 ------ files?
 
 Each time a player enters a multiplayer game, the server will send 
 any logo and audio taunt files that are being used in the game. This 
 way when someone sends an audio taunt for example rather than  
 transmitting the audio each time only a signal packet is required to 
 tell your system which file to play.

 When you join a game, only files you don't already have will be sent.

 Versions prior to 1.4 had a flaw that allowed many files to be sent 
 over and over causing duplication. This has been fixed in version 
 1.4. So it is a good idea to trim away the extra and duplicate 
 files.


 [5.14] What about Lag and Loss while playing?
 ---------------------------------------------

 Lag and packet loss are always a problem with online gaming. It is 
 the nature of the internet. Some information is delayed, and some is 
 lost. A complete description and discussion would take many pages. 
 We will offer a brief overview and try to relay the concepts 
 involved.

 A fairly long discussion is offered at the link below. It is centered 
 around  Descent 2, which works significantly different than D3, but 
 still can offer a good deal of information on the subject and 
 concepts.

 http://www.myrkul.org/descent.html 

 D3, being a server based game means that the server decides what 
 was 'real'. The only variation to this is the peer to peer model, 
 where each client determines if they were hit by an incoming shot. 
 In the Dedicated C/S and the hosted C/S, the server will always make 
 the decision. 
 
 This means that lag and packet loss effect what you see, what you 
 aim at, and what the server does.

 In short, Lag is the time it takes for data to make a round trip from 
 the client (player) to the server and back again. The longer this  
 period is the more lag there is, and the more difficult it can be to 
 play and hit your target. The player needs to adjust for this period 
 by leading the target. That is to aim in front of the target, where 
 it will be in say 250 ms for example. Since by the time your shot 
 reaches the server that is how far the target may have moved this 
 can be very difficult against a good pilot. A good pilot will move 
 often and in an erratic manner, making it very difficult to judge 
 where to fire.

 Loss, or packet loss is when information being sent or recieved is 
 lost due to data error or internet problems. This can cause some  
 strange effects such as seeing ships 'skipping' or 'warping' from 
 one point to another. Things such as shots that should have been a 
 direct hit doing no damage.

 For example, if you fire a laser at a target, and the packet to the 
 server is  dropped then the server never receives the shot, and no 
 damage is done. Even though on your screen you saw the laser hit the 
 target.

 This is also true in the peer to peer model. It may appear that a 
 shot should  have hit the target, when in fact the packet was lost. 
 The best way to know you have hit a target is when you see the blue 
 shield sphere around the ship glow. That shows that it is taking 
 damage.

 D3 uses two basic types of packets. We will cover both briefly.

 Unreliable Packets:
 Are used to send ship position and weapons fire packets. As the name
 implies, this information is sent without any form of checks. It is 
 assumed that the data was delivered. These packets are sent at a rate 
 which can be altered by the server at start up. This is done with the 
 pps (packets per second) setting.
 
 As an example, if a game is configured for 7pps, which is a common 
 setting for online games then once every 143ms the server will send  
 position information to the client. At the same rate the client will 
 send position information to the server.

 If the fire rate of a weapon or battle exceeds the setting it is 
 effectively increased. In other words, each time a fire packet needs 
 to be send, it is sent. Each fire packet contains position 
 information as well. If a fire packet fills the need for that 
 periods position information then no posistion-only packet will be 
 sent. This helps to reduce bandwidth requirements.

 If a client connects to a server that is set for 7pps, and the client 
 is using a 28.8 modem for example, it will inform the server and the 
 server will alter the rate for that client to 5pps.

 Reliable Packets: Are used to send all other types of information. 
 Such as damage, deaths, powerup spawns, powerup pickups, level events 
 such as doors.

 As the name implies these packets are checked by means of an 
 acknowledgement.  If a packet fails it will be resent. These packets 
 are sent as needed, but at a maximum rate of 10 per second, or once 
 every 100ms. The reliable packet will wait (2 * ping time) for a 
 response, then assume it was lost and resend.


 [5.15] What packet per second setting should I use?
 ---------------------------------------------------

 The packets per second setting has two sides, the server and the 
 client. The server or host setting determines the maximum pps that 
 will be used by any client. For a server the determination is based 
 on the bandwidth of the connection the server has, and the number of 
 players in the game. As a rule of thumb using 7 or 8 pps seems best 
 for online games. When setting up a server allow for 30 to 40 
 kilobits per second per client. As an example, if a game was to have 
 4 players the server should have at least 128kbits per second upload 
 ability.

 It is also important to remember when starting a server or hosted 
 game that items like mines (proximity mines, seeker mines, bouncing 
 betties) greatly increase the required bandwidth for servers and 
 players. They are best left out of online games.

 The client setting is determined in the setup screen of D3 under the 
 network tab. It offers six possible settings, and should be set 
 according to the type of connection or modem you have. The settings 
 are,

 28.8K Modem  ....................... 5pps
 33.6K Modem  ....................... 6pps
 28.8K Modem  ....................... 7pps
 Single Channel ISDN ................ 8pps
 Dual Channel ISDN, Cable Modems .... 9pps
 T1, ADSL, 3, etc. .................. 12pps

 If you have a 56k modem that commonly only connects at 28.8 for 
 example, then you should select the 28.8 setting. Also D3 will 
 automatically adjust the pps of a client if it detects to much 
 packet loss during a game.


 [5.16] What is triple chording and how does it affect my gameplay?
 ------------------------------------------------------------------

 Triple chording is a method used to increase the effective speed of 
 the ship. The ships allow for travel in three directions,  
 forward/reverse, slide up/down, and slide left/right. By combining 
 any three directions you effectively increase the speed of the ship 
 to 1.7x. If only two directions are used then the increase is 1.4x. 

 For example, if you move forward while sliding up and to the right 
 you will move at a much higher speed than forward alone. This 
 requires that you tilt the ship, in this case down and to the left to 
 continue toward your target. This requires a bit of practice, but can 
 be the difference between life and death in a multiplayer game.


 [5.17] What's the Piggyback/observer mode?
 ------------------------------------------

 D3 allows a player to enter one of two modes of observer. These 
 modes are selected by pressing the F6 key while in a multiplayer 
 game followed by using the arrow keys to select observer from the 
 menu.

 The first mode, known simply as observer mode allows the player to 
 fly as a 'ghost'. The player is allowed to wander freely about the 
 level, observing the game or exploring the level. In this mode you 
 can not be seen by any other players nor can you fire at or damage 
 other players. In this mode the ship will also be able to move faster 
 than normal to aid in watching battles and things.

 The second mode is known as piggyback mode. In this mode you attach 
 yourself to another player in the game as if you are looking through 
 his eyes. In this mode a screen update is sent only at the rate of 
 the packets per second setting. This can give a rather choppy view. 
 For example in a game set for 7pps, you will only see 7 frames per 
 second.

 Both of these can be useful when learning the game, to see what 
 other players do, what tricks and techniques they use.


 [5.18] Is there a way to bypass the PXO GUI?
 --------------------------------------------
 
 Yes, you can get a tool called 'Gate' @ http://www.frontnet.org/~m0l/
 which will provide you with an interface you're used to from other 
 chat clients like mIRC or KALI. It allows multiple private chat 
 windows, game listings from chat, and many other user friendly 
 items.


 =======================
  [6] Dedicated Servers
 =======================


 [6.1] What sort of system is required to run a dedicated server?
 ----------------------------------------------------------------

 At a minimum a Pentium 133 with 40 megs of RAM. A safer bet is a 
 minimum of a Pentium 166 or better with 64 megs of RAM. The faster 
 the better. Some people have servers on lesser systems, such as a 
 Pentium 75 with 32 megs. This will work, and likely play ok for 
 smaller games.


 [6.2] How much bandwidth do I need to run a server?
 ---------------------------------------------------

 The upstream bandwidth is most important for a dedicated server. That
 is the speed at which your connection can upload data to the  
 internet.

 A good rule of thumb is 30 to 40 kilobits per second per player. So 
 for example if your connection is an ADSL line with 128kbit upload, 
 then you can run a 3 or 4 player dedicated server. If you do not 
 allow enough bandwidth the game will be bad for everyone.


 [6.3] What sort of settings should I use in general?
 ----------------------------------------------------

 A good setup for an online server is to use 7 or 8 pps (packets per 
 second). Also 'AccurateCollisions' sould be disabled, as it is by 
 default. Rotational Velocity 'SendRotVel' should also be disabled, 
 as it is by default, since it makes the position packets larger.

 A common config file might look like this:

 [server config file]
 PPS=7
 Maxplayers=4
 TimeLimit=60
 KillGoal=0
 RespawnTime=30
 GameName=My Game
 MissionName=fury.mn3
 Scriptname=Anarchy
 ConnectionName=Parallax Online
 PXOUsername=<username>
 PXOPassword=<password>
 SetDifficulty=3
 AccurateCollions=0
 SendRotVel=0

 The last two commands are by default set to zero (off) so if they 
 are not included that is fine.


 [6.4] Some people say I should disallow all the mines, why?
 -----------------------------------------------------------

 This is true for online games. Mines of all kinds, including 
 Proximity Mines, Seeker Mines, Bouncing Betties are all handled as 
 robots, so they send out position packets just like a robot or 
 another player. This can and will quickly overload an online  
 connection.

 These can be removed, or disallowed from any server by including
 the commands in the config file.

 Example:

 DisallowPowerUp=Betty4Pack
 DisallowPowerUp=ProxMinePowerup
 DisallowPowerUp=Seeker3Pack


 [6.5] How do I know what server commands are available?
 -------------------------------------------------------

 The manual offers a list and description of the most common commands. 
 You can also type $help  from the server console to get a list. 
 Additionaly you can type $help <command name> to get a little more 
 detail.

 Example:

 $help kick   will diplay the info on the kick command.


 [6.6] Can I talk to players on my dedicated server?
 ---------------------------------------------------

 Yes, it is very simple. Just place the word 'say' in front of any 
 messages. The '$' is not required, and should not be used for this 
 command. You can also send private messages to a player or team by 
 using the the player's name.

 Examples:

 say hi I am the server (will send "Hi I am the server" to all 
 players).  say bigboy:Hi this is a private message (sent only to the 
 pilot bigboy). say bi:Hi this is a private message (sent only to the 
 pilot bigboy, or any pilots whose names begin with the letters 'bi').


 [6.7] How do I get a message to appear to the players as they enter 
 ----- the game?
 
 A Message Of The Day may be added to the dedicated config file which 
 will   display for a few seconds to each player when they enter/join 
 the server. This is useful to give a contact email address to report 
 problems, or the like.

 This is done using the undocemented command MOTD. In the dedicated 
 config just add a line such as MOTD=My Message.

 Example:


 MOTD=Report any problem to JohnDoe@Email.com


 [6.8] When I use the $scores command it runs off screen, I can't see
 ----- anything!
 
 The $scores command allows an additional parameter to be added. This
 allows the server operator to see only top portion of the list. This 
 is useful for many things, including seeing the pings of the active 
 players.

 Example:

 $scores 10<enter>
 Will display only the top 10 lines of the scores screen.


 [6.9] Can I do remote administration, if so how?
 ------------------------------------------------

 Yes. D3 allows you to TelNet into a server remotely and do any of the
 tasks or commands allowed locally. To do this you will need to add a 
 couple of lines to the dedicated config file as follows.

 AllowRemoteConsole=1          (enables the function)
 ConsolePassword=<password>    (login password)

 Example:

 AllowRemoteConsole=1
 ConsolePassword=secret

 Then with a TelNet program, such as that included with Windows you 
 enter the IP address of the remote server, and a port number which by 
 default is 2092. You will be prompted for the (case sensitive) login 
 password, simply enter it. You can then enter any console command 
 such as $help.

 If you would like to use an alternate port for control, or are 
 running multiple servers on a single system which will require 
 alternate ports for each server, add the command 'RemoteConsolePort' 
 to assign the port in the dedicated config 
 file.

 Example:

 RemoteConsolePort=2093


 [6.10] Can I run more than one server on a single computer?
 -----------------------------------------------------------

 Yes, with a few extra commands it can be done. Keep in mind that a
 more powerful computer is required. For example to run 2 servers on 
 one compter it should be a 400MHz+ system with 128Megs of RAM.

 You will need to use the '-useport' command to assign an alternate 
 game port. You will need to use the '-tempdir' command to assign an 
 alternate temp dir. Also you should not alter the default framecap 
 when running multiple servers.

 As an example, we can step through the requirements. We will assume 
 you want to run two servers on one system. The first server can/will 
 use all of the default ports and directories. So it would be launched 
 as follows.

 From the D3 Launcher command line (under Setup, Misc):

 -dedicated server1.cfg

 To launch from the command line in the D3 directory it would be:

 main -launched -dedicated server1.cfg

 This server will use game port 2092, and remote admin port 2092, as 
 well as the D3 default temp directory.

 The second server will require a temp directory, so create one. For 
 example create a directery call d3temp in the root of C: (i.e. MD 
 C:\d3temp).

 From the D3 Launcher command line (under Setup, Misc):

 -dedicated server2.cfg -useport 2093 -tempdir C:\d3temp

 To launch from the command line in the D3 directory it would be:

 main -launched -dedicated server2.cfg -useport 2093 -tempdir 
 C:\d3temp 

 This server will use game port 2093, and temp directory C:\d3temp.

 If you want to be able to TelNet in using remote admin, you will need
 to include a line in server2.cfg. For example, 
 RemoteConsolePort=2093. Then the remote admin functions of both 
 servers are available, one at port 2092, one at port 2093.


 [6.11] Can I do administration from within the game, if so how?
 ---------------------------------------------------------------

 Yes, limited or basic admin is allowed from with in the game, i.e. 
 when you are in the game as a client/player. This requires that a 
 simple text file be written and placed in the D3 directory, and 
 that a command option be added at launch time.

 A file named <filename>.dmfc must be created that contains the 
 following lines:

 remoteadminpass <password>
 remoteadmin on

 For example a file called ingame.dmfc might be created that reads:

 remoteadminpass secret
 remoteadmin on

 When launching D3 simply add the command -autoexec ingame.dmfc.
 
 When playing in a game, you can then login and enter basic commands.

 To login while in the game,

 Press F8 (the chat key)
 type "$remote login <password>" (in this case 'secret' without the 
 quotes)

 You will see a message indicating that login was sucessful.

 You can then enter commands by again pressing the F8 key, and 
 preceeding each command with "$remote" (without the quotes).

 Example:

 $remote $setmaxplayers 5    would change the max number of player to
                             5 (which is the server + four clients).


 [6.12] What is the MultiSettingsFile command all about?
 -------------------------------------------------------
 
 The MultiSettingsFile command allows you save a game setup config 
 created via the 'Start'Game' menu. Then call that config file when 
 starting a dedicated  server. It is used by entering the command 
 along with a path and file name.

 MultiSettingsFile=<drive:\path\filename.mps>

 The default path of these settings files is C:\Games\Descent3\Custom\
 Settings.

 The file is created by the following steps:

 - Enter the Multiplayer menu
 - Select a connection type (even if it is different from what you will want in
   the dedicated server, as that can be overridden). Direct TCP/IP is the   
   simplest choice.
 - Click 'Start New Game'
 - Select the game type, game name, mission, etc.
 - Select Multiplayer options menu and set the pps, timelimit, respawn, etc.
 
  - Select Configure allowed Ships/Items if you like to remove items 
   you do not  want in the game.
 - Click 'Done'
 - Click 'Save Settings'
 - In the line that by default reads 'C:\Games\Descent3\Custom\Settings' add the
   filename you wish to save this configuration as. For example: 
   'C:\Games\Descent3\Custom\Settings\Mysetup.mps'
 - Click Save.

 There is now a file called 'Mysetup.mps' in the settings directory.
 To use this as a basis for starting dedicated servers simply include 
 it as the first command in the dedicated config file. It should be 
 first so that any other commands can override settings you want 
 changed. For example:

 [server config file]
 MultiSettingsFile=C:\Games\Descent3\Custom\Settings\Mysetup.mps
 PPS=7
 Maxplayers=4
 ConnectionName=Parallax Online
 PXOUsername=<username>
 PXOPassword=<password>
 
 The commands that follow override those contained in the MPS file. 
 So the connection type, pps, etc. can be altered.

 The command is very useful if there a group of weapons you always 
 wish to exclude from games for example, without having to use the  
 DisAllowPowerUp command line after line.


 [6.13] Can I disallow certain ships, if so how?
 -----------------------------------------------

 This can be done. It requires that an MPS file be created. MPS stands
 for MultiPlayerSettings. See the section above on the use and  
 creation of MPS files.

 To disallow a ship or ships, simply disallow them in the screen for 
 'Configure allowed Ships/Items' when creating an MPS file. When a 
 player enters a game with a disallowed ship, it will be forced to a 
 PyroGL.


 [6.14] I understand 'DisallowPowerUp', why is there an AllowPowerUp
 ------ command?

 The AllowPowerUp command is the opposite of DisAllowPowerUp. It is 
 mainly used to add items back that may have been disallowed with the 
 use of an MPS file.

 As an example you may base a number of dedicated server files off of 
 a single  MPS file. That MPS file may disallow the Napalm Cannon. Yet 
 in one of the  dedicated server configs you want the Napalm Cannon. 
 So you would simply add the AllowPowerUp command after the 
 MultiSettingsFile command.

 Example:

 [server config file]
 MultiSettingsFile=C:\Games\Descent3\Custom\Settings\Mysetup.mps
 AllowPowerUp=Napalm

 The AllowPowerUp command must follow the MultiSettingsFile command, 
 since all it is doing is resetting the variable found in the MPS 
 file.


 [6.15] What does -framecap have to do with a server?
 ----------------------------------------------------

 The server, just like the client runs at a default framerate of 
 50fps. Although the server does not actually render video of the 
 game, it does all of the server calculations such as missile tracking 
 for example.
 
 If the server is dedicated to running a single game, and nothing else
 this framecap can be removed. It may make for a more accurate game, 
 particularly on LAN. This is done by simply adding the command '-
 framecap 999' (without the quotes) to the launch command. As with 
 the client you can also choose a different framecap.

 This should not be done if the system running the computer has 
 multiple servers running, or is running any other tasks.



 ======================
  [7] Development/MODs
 ======================
 
  
 [7.1] I wanna make my own levels, is an editor available?
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 
 YES! At http://d3edit.tricordnet.com you can get the latest version 
 of D3 Edit. As D3 has a new, more complex engine the editor is kinda 
 complex and more difficult to use than the old DMB2. However, at the 
 aforementioned address you'll get some really helpful tutorials on 
 building your first levels so it's definitely worth checking out.
 

 [7.2] Is a converter available so I can play my favourite D1/D2 
 ----- levels in D3?  
 
 Currently not. Though rumours have been confirmed that such a 
 converter exists, the author almost definitely does not plan to 
 release it to prevent tons of unapproved ports of original D1/D2 
 levels.
 
 A possible way to port a certain level (after having received the 
 author's permission, certainly) is to get the Descent Manager tool 
 'Levelview' from http://www.descent2.com/descman/ and convert the 
 level to the dxf-format. After that you can convert it to the 
 Outrage room format with dxf2orf 
 (http://www.tricordnet.com/2orf/dxf2orf.zip).

 Now you've got the whole level as a room file that can be imported 
 into D3 Edit. However, you got to flip most of the normals manually 
 as well as retexture the whole level plus add all the scripting and 
 stuff which is quite a lot of work...


 [7.3] What assistance can I get to make my own D3 MODs? 
 -------------------------------------------------------
 
 Well, currently some MOD's are already available (see section [8.3])
 and others in are the works. Possibly the best place to start for 
 you if you wanna work on MODs yourself is the D3sdk Webpage @ 
 http://d3sdk.warpcore.org/. As they say:

 'This should be one of the most extensive resources for making D3 
  Mods on the web. We have several great minds at work to help  
  everyone get the creative juices flowing. Hopefully we can help 
  you unlock and create the most mind blowing mods to ever hit the 
  multiplayer scene. The Sky is the Limit and we're here to help you 
  get there.'
 
 Another fairly good resource is http://www.xtremebuilder.com/ with 
 lots of tutorials and professional stuff as well. Go and see for 
 yourself!
