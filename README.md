This is the Descent 3 open source engine, licensed under [GPL-3.0](https://github.com/DescentDevelopers/Descent3?tab=GPL-3.0-1-ov-file). It includes the '1.5' patch written by Kevin Bentley and Jeff Slutter several years ago and brought to a stable condition by the Descent community.

In order to use this, you must provide your own game files. See the **Usage** section for details.

## Version 1.5 Notes
There is no "release" yet. The current milestone is "1.5 Stable", which is meant to more or less be Descent 3 as it might have been if the 1.5 patch had made it to retail years ago. Artifacts can be downloaded from the [Actions](https://github.com/DescentDevelopers/Descent3/actions) tab.
The milestone needs testing on all platforms. Please report issues when found.

## Usage
1. Make sure that you have a copy of Descent 3. You can purchase a copy of Descent 3 from [GOG](https://www.gog.com/game/descent_3_expansion) or [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/273590/Descent_3/).
2. Install Descent 3.

    - **Note for Steam users:** If you own Descent 3 on Steam, then it’s recommended that you install the Windows version of the game even if you’re running macOS or Linux, otherwise movies will not work due to [current lack of Ogv support](https://github.com/DescentDevelopers/Descent3/issues/240). You can use either [Steam Play](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/08F7-5D56-9654-39AF) or [SteamCMD](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD#Cross-Platform_Installation) to install the Windows version of the game on macOS or Linux.

    - **Note for non-Windows users:** If you have the Windows version of the game on CDs but you don’t want to use Windows to install them, then you can follow these instructions:

        <ol type="1">
            <li>Make sure that you have <a href="https://www.winehq.org">Wine</a> installed.</li>
            <li><i>(Recommended)</i> Run <code>winecfg</code> and make sure that “Emulate a virtual desktop” is enabled.</li>
            <li>
                <p><i>(Optional)</i> Determine if you’re going to be affected by a bug with Descent 3’s installer, and potentially apply a workaround:</p>

                    <li>Download <a href="https://codeberg.org/JasonYundt/environment-size-checker">Environment Size Checker</a>.</li>

                    <li>If that program tells you that your environment is more than 32,724 bytes large, then you’ll need to unset or shorten environment variables before running Descent 3’s installer. If you don’t, then the installer will page fault.</li>

3. If your version of Descent 3 is older than v1.4, then [update it to v1.4](http://descent3.com/downloads.php).
4. Create a new folder named `D3-open-source`.
5. Copy the following files from your installation of Descent 3 to `D3-open-source`:
    - All `.hog` files
    - The `missions` folder
    - _(Optional)_ All `.pld` files
    - _(Optional)_ The `demo` folder
    - _(Optional)_ The `movies` folder
6. Create the following folders in `D3-open-source`:
    - `custom/`
    - `custom/cache/`
7. Obtain new Descent 3 engine files:
    - If you want to use pre-built binaries, then download one of the artifacts from our latest CI run. You can find a list of CI runs [here](https://github.com/DescentDevelopers/Descent3/actions/workflows/build.yml?query=branch%3Amain).
    - If you want to build the engine files yourself, the follow [these instructions](#building). Once you build the engine files, they’ll be put in `builds/<platform>/Descent3/<build-type>/`. For example, if you’re using Linux and you create a “Release” build, then the files will be located at `builds/linux/Descent3/Release`.
8. Copy all of the new engine files into `D3-open-source` and overwrite any conflicts.
9. Run the game:
    - On Windows, run `D3-open-source\Descent3.exe`.
    - On other platforms, run `D3-open-source/Descent3`.
10. Special notes:
    - D3 Open Source compiles level scripts in their own hogfiles. Make sure you copy and overwrite `d3-{platform}.hog`.
