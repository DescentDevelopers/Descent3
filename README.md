# Descent 3
This is the Descent 3 open source engine, licensed under [GPL-3.0](https://github.com/DescentDevelopers/Descent3?tab=GPL-3.0-1-ov-file). It includes the '1.5' patch written by Kevin Bentley and Jeff Slutter several years ago and brought to a stable condition by the Descent community. 

In order to use this, you must provide your own game files. See the **Usage** section for details.

## Version 1.5 Notes
There is no "release" yet. The current milestone is "1.5 Stable", which is meant to more or less be Descent 3 as it might have been if the 1.5 patch had made it to retail years ago. Artifacts can be downloaded from the [Actions](https://github.com/DescentDevelopers/Descent3/actions) tab. 
The milestone needs testing on all platforms. Please report issues when found.

## Usage
Purchase Descent 3 from a reputable source and install it, then replace the main binary with your build. See your platform below:

#### Windows
In the install folder, rename `main.exe` to `main.old` and take your built `Descent3.exe`, name it `main.exe`, and add it to the install folder.

#### MacOS
Right-click Descent3.app, click Show Package Contents. Back up your `Descent3` binary and drop your built `Descent3` binary into the install (Contents/MacOS) folder.

#### Linux
Back up your `Descent3` binary and drop your built `Descent3` binary into the install folder.
