This is the Descent 3 open source engine, licensed under [GPL-3.0](https://github.com/DescentDevelopers/Descent3?tab=GPL-3.0-1-ov-file). It includes the '1.5' patch written by Kevin Bentley and Jeff Slutter several years ago and brought to a stable condition by the Descent community.

In order to use this, you must provide your own game files. See the [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) file for details about installation.

To build the game, follow build instructions in the [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) file.

Build or runtime issues should be reported on our [GitHub tracker](https://github.com/DescentDevelopers/Descent3/issues).
