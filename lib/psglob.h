// Returns 1 if string contains globbing characters in it
int PSGlobHasPattern(char *string);

//	PSGlobMatch
//	Matches the pattern passed in to the string in text.  If the pattern matches
//	it returns 1, if not, it returns 0. In order to have a match, the following
//	conditions must be met:
//	1) The entire string (text) is used for matching.
//	2) '*' matches any sequence of characters.
//	3) '?' matches any character
//	4) [SET] matches any character in the specified set.
//	5) [!SET] matches any character _not_ in the specified set.
//		A set is composed of characters or ranges.  A range looks like
//		character hyphen character (as in 0-9 or A-Z). [0-9a-zA-Z_] is the set
//		of all characters allowed in C identifiers.
//	6) Any other character in the pattern must be matched exactly.(see 9)
//	7) Because of the syntactic significance of []*?!- and \ to match
//		these characters exactly, preced it with a '\'.
//	8) If dot_special is not zero, '*' and '?' do not match '.' at the beginning of text
//	9) If case_sensitive is 0, than case does not matter for the non-pattern characters
int PSGlobMatch(char *pattern, char *text, int case_sensitive, int dot_special);

// Like PSGlobMatch, but match pattern against any final segment of text
int PSGlobMatchAfterStar(char *pattern, int case_sensitive, char *text);
