/*	Win32 Application Object
                This object entails initialization and cleanup of all operating system
                elements, as well as data that libraries may need to initialize their
                systems.

        The Win32 Application object creates the application window and housekeeps
        the window and instance handle for the application.

        We also allow the option of setting these handles from outside the Application object.


tOEWin32MsgCallback:
        Callbacks return a 0 if we don't want to call the default action for the message, otherwise return 1
        Callbacks are executed in the Window's message procedure, so the calling program need not manually run
        the handler (although, I give you a function to do just that, if you can't depend on the WndProc).
        NOTE: the callbacks are executed in the window's root procedure and not in the inherited WndProc function.
        This means, that callbacks have priority over the application defined WndProc.

        General priority of message handling.
                Outrage Window Procedure:
                        takes care of window creation, destruction and system menus.
                        if message's window not registered then
                                calls Win32 Window Procedure
                        else
                                runs OEWin32MsgCallbacks for that message
                                if OEWin32MsgCallback functions return 0 then
                                        leave Outrage Window Procedure

                                calls oeWin32Application->WndProc hierarchy which
                                        optionally calls Win32 Window Procedure.
