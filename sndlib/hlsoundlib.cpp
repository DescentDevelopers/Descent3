 *
 * 90    2/12/99 2:10p Chris
 *
 * 89    2/12/99 1:54p Sean

 * 85    2/12/99 11:22a Chris
 * Updated what BOA uses for BOA_cost_array.  It is not just the distance
 * from the center of the room to the center of the portal.  It was this +
 * the dist to the next room's center.  The reason for this change was it
 * makes it easier to compute the exact BOA_DIST for sounds.  This is
 * because the two distances are seperated (so from the start pos, we do a
 * vm_Vect dist from the start point to the portal)...  Hmmm....
 *
