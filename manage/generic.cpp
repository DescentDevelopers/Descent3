 * changes to fix addon tablefile support so it works correctly
 *
 * 92    4/25/99 10:19p Matt
 * Fixed multiplayer and demo problems will killing an object from script,
 * and cleaned up the death code a bit in the process.
 *
 * 91    4/22/99 7:08p Matt
 * Reduced the number of object sounds from 3 to 2, since we were only
 * using two.
 *
 * 90    4/19/99 3:57p Matt
 * Took out guidebot velocity hack.
 *
 * 89    4/18/99 4:49p Matt
