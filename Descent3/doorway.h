 *
 * 15    5/05/99 12:58a Matt
 * Added doorway flag to tell the Guide-Bot to ignore the locked state of
 * the door.
 *
 * 14    4/23/99 8:28p Kevin
 * trying to get doors working in save/load games
 *
 * 13    4/20/99 8:35p Matt
 * Changed ActivateDoorway() to not exit if a door is locked.   It's the
 * caller's responsibility to check if the door is openable (if he cares)
 * before activating.
 *
 * 12    4/20/99 6:55p Matt
 * Added code to keep a bitmask of all keys held by all players, and to
 * allow a robot to open a door if any player has the key(s) for that
 * door.
 *
 * 11    2/06/99 10:03p Matt
 * Added keys system
 *
 * 10    2/04/99 2:05p Matt
 * Added blastable doors
 *
 * 9     1/29/99 12:47p Matt
 * Rewrote the doorway system
 *
 * 8     9/08/98 12:06p Jason
 * added automatic reinitting of doors when rooms get deleted
 *
 * 7     10/06/97 1:03p Samir
 * Took out script name.  Doorways are objects, and if there is a custom
 * script for a doorway, we look at it's object.
 *
 * 6     10/06/97 1:01p Jason
 * made doors work with scripts (sort of)
 *
 * 5     10/03/97 12:51p Jason
 * added GetDoorwayNumFromObject function
 *
 * 4     10/03/97 12:24p Jason
