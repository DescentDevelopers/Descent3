 *
 * 14    5/02/99 2:52a Jeff
 * fixed spewers for turrets/rotaters
 *
 * 13    4/29/99 7:50p Jason
 * fixed spew errors
 *
 * 12    10/18/98 9:04p Jeff
 * sped up spew by saving values?
 *
 * 11    8/19/98 5:36p Samir
 * moved some stuff from source to header file.
 *
 * 10    8/19/98 1:44p Samir
 * added array of spew extern
 *
 * 9     2/04/98 6:09p Matt
 * Changed object room number to indicate a terrain cell via a flag.  Got
 * rid of the object flag which used to indicate terrain.
 *
 * 8     2/02/98 5:40p Luke
 *
 * 7     2/02/98 3:10p Jeff
 * new handle system, makes more reliable
 *
 * 6     1/28/98 6:29p Jeff
 * Added the "RISCy" layer between predef statements and the game
 *
 * 5     1/26/98 11:01a Jeff
 * changed spew struct to use object handles
 *
 * 4     1/23/98 7:00p Jeff
 * checked object before using it bug fixed
 *
 * 3     1/23/98 5:18p Jeff
 * Added in new timer and 3/5 of the random flags
 *
 * 2     1/23/98 3:03p Jeff
