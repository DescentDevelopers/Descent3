 *
 * 20    4/25/99 10:38p Matt
 * Made the Osiris kill object function work on players.
 *
 * 19    4/25/99 10:19p Matt
 * Fixed multiplayer and demo problems will killing an object from script,
 * and cleaned up the death code a bit in the process.
 *
 * 18    4/24/99 4:32p Jason
 * made fusion damage sound not be irritating
 *
 * 17    4/02/99 11:23a Matt
 * Made KillObject not take a death_info struct, but rather the death info
 * as individual parameters.  Moved death_info into objinfo.h, since it's
 * only used for generic objects.  Took out fade-away death hack, now that
 * fade-away deaths can be explicitely set.
 *
 * 16    3/22/99 2:00p Matt
 * Moved breaking glass code from collide.cpp to damage.cpp
 *
 * 15    2/25/99 11:01a Matt
 * Added new explosion system.
 *
 * 14    1/20/99 2:13a Chris
 * It is now possible for robots to have special immunities, resistances,
 * and vunerabilities
 *
 * 13    11/28/98 3:11p Jason
 * made damage glow much more apparent
 *
 * 12    11/19/98 5:40p Kevin
 * Demo system
 *
 * 11    10/19/98 11:20p Matt
 * Changed player damage types to start at 0 instead of -1 to avoid -1 ->
 * 255 problem in multiplayer.
 *
 * 10    10/19/98 7:19p Matt
 * Added system to support different types of damage to the player and
 * have these different types make different sounds.
 *
 * 9     5/04/98 4:12p Chris
 *
 * 8     5/04/98 4:04p Chris
 * Minestone checkin' -- energy effect and more AI functionality
 *
 * 7     4/17/98 1:59p Jason

 *
 * 6     2/18/98 3:43a Mark
