 *
 * Trigger header
 *
 * $Log: /DescentIII/main/trigger.h $
 *
 * 17    5/20/99 9:03p Matt
 * Changed trigger system so that collisions with rendered portals don't
 * set off triggers on the portals.
 *
 * 16    4/14/99 3:57a Jeff
 * fixed case mismatch in #includes
 *
 * 15    3/23/99 5:52p Matt
 * Added clutter activators for triggers
 *
 * 14    2/21/99 4:35p Chris
 * Improving the level goal system...  Not done.
 *
 * 13    2/11/99 1:10p Matt
 * Added functions to get & set a triggers enabled/disabled state
 *
 * 12    1/21/99 11:34a Matt
 * Got rid of portal triggers.  Since we don't have multi-face portals, a
 * face trigger works fine for a portal.  Also fixed a few editor/trigger
 * bugs.
 *
 * 11    1/14/99 11:06a Matt
 * Added names to triggers
 *
 * 10    1/08/99 2:56p Samir
 * Ripped out OSIRIS1.
 *
 * 9     12/16/98 10:18p Jeff
 * added new osiris struct members
 *
 * 8     4/24/98 1:53a Samir
 * added trigger init and free.
 *
 * 7     2/03/98 11:12a Samir
 * If pointer passed to TRIGNUM is NULL return -1.
 *
 * 6     1/20/98 4:12p Samir
 * New script housekeeping system.
 *
 * 5     9/24/97 6:18p Samir
 * Use script names instead of script id values to identify scripts.
 *
 * 4     9/12/97 3:58p Matt
 * Added support for activators and one-shot triggers
 *
 * 3     9/11/97 1:57p Matt
 * Added trigger struct & a bunch of functions.  System is not done yet,
 * though.
 *
 * 2     9/08/97 10:01a Matt
 * Ripped out old trigger code
 *
 * $NoKeywords: $
