 *
 * 34    4/30/99 5:40p Jason
 * fixed some issues with release builds
 *
 * 33    4/29/99 5:43p Chris
 * Added the check for bad center points
 *
 * 32    4/26/99 11:11a Chris
 * Updated Bnode system
 *
 * 31    4/20/99 8:55p Chris
 * Fixed problem with robots not being able to open locked doors that a
 * player has the key for.
 *
 * 30    4/18/99 5:39a Chris
 * Vastly improved the path node system
 *
 * 29    2/25/99 5:43p Chris
 * Massive improvement to BOA and AI (again)
 *
 * 28    2/24/99 12:27p Chris
 * Fixed problems with GB finding robots/room he couldn't get to.  Fixed
 * problems with forcefields(sound prop. and path finding).  Fixed
 * problems with small portals.
 *
 * 27    2/12/99 11:22a Chris
 * Updated what BOA uses for BOA_cost_array.  It is not just the distance
 * from the center of the room to the center of the portal.  It was this +
 * the dist to the next room's center.  The reason for this change was it
 * makes it easier to compute the exact BOA_DIST for sounds.  This is
 * because the two distances are seperated (so from the start pos, we do a
 * vm_Vect dist from the start point to the portal)...  Hmmm....
 *
 * 26    2/09/99 12:41p Chris
 *
 * 25    2/09/99 12:40p Chris
 * More aipath stuff has been merged with the new BOA
 *
 * 24    2/09/99 12:17p Chris
 *
 * 23    2/09/99 9:58a Chris
 * Massive BOA update  :)  Terrain happy now.  Vis happy now.  Sound happy
 * now.
 *
 * 22    1/11/99 2:14p Chris
 * Massive work on OSIRIS and AI
 *
 * 21    12/11/98 1:55p Chris
 * Reduced BOA's size and changed how it works with no path situations
 *
 * 20    12/09/98 10:41a Jason
 * fixed BOA problems with lighting
 *
 * 19    9/16/98 12:07p Chris
 * Improved BOA AABB computation with room checksums
 *
 * 18    8/04/98 2:32p Chris
 * Improved attach code added more fixes to the AABB partial computation
 * patch
 *
 * 17    8/03/98 5:47p Chris
 * Improved the partial AABB computation
 *
 * 16    7/21/98 2:14p Chris

 * 11    5/03/98 8:36p Chris
 * Additional debug info
 *
 * 10    4/28/98 12:01p Matt
 * Dropped MAX_PATH_PORTALS from 100 down to 40.
 *
 * 9     4/22/98 6:38p Matt
