 * $Author: Ardussi $
 *
 * Defines and structs external for DLLs
 *
 * $Log: /DescentIII/Main/gamecinematics_external.h $
 *
 * 13    5/10/99 10:22p Ardussi
 * changes to compile on Mac
 *
 * 12    5/04/99 6:53p Jeff
 * added new canned cinematic to fade screen to white and endlevel.  Fixed
 * crash bug with invalid player path for canned cine with player paths
 *
 * 11    4/04/99 8:21p Matt
 * Fixed include problems with osiris vector stuff.  Osiris headers now
 * include vecmat_external.h, instead of defining the typedefs, structs,
 * and inlines on the Osiris side.
 *
 * 10    3/27/99 7:22p Jeff
 * fixed cinematics when going from one cut to another immediatly.  Added
 * start transition
 *
 * 9     2/28/99 8:32p Jeff
 * added fade and move player dallas action.  Fixed the end-level sequence
 * changing view back to player for split second.
 *
 * 8     2/22/99 1:20a Jeff
 * added support for inventory (simple) in dallas.  Moved end-level
 * sequence to use IGC.  Add position clipboard stuff for dallas.  Fixed
 * some inventory bug with storing object handles
 *
 * 7     2/21/99 8:36p Jeff
 * misc changes to handle new matcen and path types of dallas
 *
 * 6     2/16/99 9:36p Jeff
 * added low text layout for cinematics
 *
 * 5     2/14/99 1:16a Jeff
 * added canned cinematic function/structures.  Added a flag to push
 * target to end of path if on a path (quick exit).  Added canned intro
 * cine.  Determine correct velocity on player ship for intro cine.
 *
 * 4     2/12/99 2:45a Jeff
 * added end-cinematic transitions
 *
 * 3     2/02/99 3:58p Jeff
 * started to implement level intro cinematic (need ai functions first).
 * No longer need camera object to do cinematic (auto-created)...path
 * cameras use speed based on distance needed to travel.
 *
 * 2     2/01/99 12:55p Jeff
 * restore correct hud mode, added flag to stop cinematics if target dies
 *
 * 1     1/31/99 10:28p Jeff
