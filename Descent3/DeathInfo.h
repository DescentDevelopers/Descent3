 * Info for object deaths

 * Moved flags from deathinfo to deathinfo_external, because the arhive
 * builder only copies the latter into the archive.
 *
 * 5     4/02/99 11:23a Matt
 * Made KillObject not take a death_info struct, but rather the death info
 * as individual parameters.  Moved death_info into objinfo.h, since it's
 * only used for generic objects.  Took out fade-away death hack, now that
 * fade-away deaths can be explicitely set.

 * FindObjOfType and OSIRIS controllable deaths
