 * pulled out some structs and defines from header files and moved them
 * into seperate header files so that multiplayer dlls don't require major
 * game headers, just those new headers.  Side effect is a shorter build
 * time.  Also cleaned up some header file #includes that weren't needed.
 * This affected polymodel.h, object.h, player.h, vecmat.h, room.h,
 * manage.h and multi.h
