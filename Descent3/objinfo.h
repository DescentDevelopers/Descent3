 *
 * Structure information about different kinds of objects
 *
 * $Log: /DescentIII/Main/objinfo.h $
 *
 * 83    9/13/01 2:31p Matt
 * Increased MAX_OBJECT_IDS from 810 to 910, and made the value the same
 * for the PC and Mac.
 *
 * 82    3/20/00 12:18p Matt
 * Merge of Duane's post-1.3 changes.

 *
 * 81    10/28/99 12:44p 3dsmax
 * Increased the number of Object IDs
 *
 * 80    10/26/99 10:32a Jeff
 * no red guidebot in non-Windows versions
 *
 * 79    10/22/99 11:30a Matt
 * Mac merge
 *
 * 78    10/20/99 5:40p Chris
 * Added the Red Guidebot
 *
 * 77    10/08/99 4:29p Chris
 *
 * 76    10/08/99 4:24p 3dsmax
 * upped number of objids (don't know who did this)
 *
 * 75    5/17/99 10:15p Matt
 * Added system for having ambient objects that get deleted at low detail
 * levels.
 *
 * 74    5/09/99 1:13p Matt
 * Made ChaffChunk a static object.
 *
 * 73    5/09/99 2:01a Matt
 * Increased max object IDs from 600 to 650.
 *
 * 72    5/06/99 1:04a Gwar
 * adding object support to new editor -- place objects with right-click
 * in orthogonal views (still needs many bug fixes :)
 *
 * 71    5/01/99 3:49a Chris
 * Added the "No scale movement properties by diff level" checkbox
 *
 * 70    4/30/99 11:54p Jeff
 * put max_object_ids back up to 600 for now
 *
 * 69    4/30/99 12:56p Kevin
 * Lowered values for MAX_SOUNDS, MAX_ROOMS, MAX_TEXTURES and MAX_OBJIDS.
 * Talk to me before changing any of these again.
 *
 * 68    4/28/99 5:06a Chris
 * Added the no-scale damage by diff checkbox
 *
 * 67    4/22/99 7:08p Matt
 * Reduced the number of object sounds from 3 to 2, since we were only
 * using two.
 *
 * 66    4/22/99 4:13p Matt
 * Deleted sounds array from the object struct, since it was never used.
 *
 * 65    4/22/99 11:33a Chris
 * Added the ability of some generic objects to be able to go through
 * forcefields and glass
 *
 * 64    4/21/99 2:50p Matt

 * and only did a call to LoadPolygonModel()

 *
 * 62    4/18/99 4:50p Matt

 * Object_info entry, which is about 2 MB overall.
 *
 * 58    4/02/99 11:23a Matt
 * Made KillObject not take a death_info struct, but rather the death info
 * as individual parameters.  Moved death_info into objinfo.h, since it's
 * only used for generic objects.  Took out fade-away death hack, now that
 * fade-away deaths can be explicitely set.
 *
 * 57    3/31/99 3:59p Chris

 * buildings)
 * anim to and from states are now shorts instead of bytes
 *
 * 51    1/21/99 11:15p Jeff
 * pulled out some structs and defines from header files and moved them
 * into seperate header files so that multiplayer dlls don't require major
 * game headers, just those new headers.  Side effect is a shorter build
 * time.  Also cleaned up some header file #includes that weren't needed.
 * This affected polymodel.h, object.h, player.h, vecmat.h, room.h,
 * manage.h and multi.h
 *
 * 50    1/19/99 4:22p Matt
