 *
 * 104   5/05/99 5:03a Gwar
 * renamed ned_GameTextures array to GameTextures in new editor to make
 * game code happy; 3D texture view still does not display textures
 *
 * 103   4/30/99 12:56p Kevin
 * Lowered values for MAX_SOUNDS, MAX_ROOMS, MAX_TEXTURES and MAX_OBJIDS.
 * Talk to me before changing any of these again.
 *
 * 102   4/21/99 5:33a Gwar
 * added a NEWEDITOR #define
 *
 * 101   3/24/99 3:27p Matt
 * Increased the max number of room changes from 20 to 100.
 *
 * 100   2/09/99 9:59a Chris
 * Massive BOA update  :)  Terrain happy now.  Vis happy now.  Sound happy
 * now.
 *
 * 99    1/21/99 11:15p Jeff
 * pulled out some structs and defines from header files and moved them
 * into seperate header files so that multiplayer dlls don't require major
 * game headers, just those new headers.  Side effect is a shorter build
 * time.  Also cleaned up some header file #includes that weren't needed.
 * This affected polymodel.h, object.h, player.h, vecmat.h, room.h,
 * manage.h and multi.h
 *

 * face trigger works fine for a portal.  Also fixed a few editor/trigger
 * bugs.
