 * $Log: /DescentIII/main/deathinfo_external.h $
 *
 * 10    4/26/99 11:39p Matt
 * Added a flag to make fly-in-air deaths no tumble
 *
 * 9     4/25/99 10:19p Matt
 * Fixed multiplayer and demo problems will killing an object from script,
 * and cleaned up the death code a bit in the process.
 *
 * 8     4/23/99 12:32a Matt
 * Added a death info option to play the explosion sound at the start of
 * the delay, instead of at the end when the object actually dies.
 *
 * 7     4/21/99 3:01p Matt
 * Added a new type for dying objects that have AI, instead of keeping a
 * flag in the dying info.
 *
 * 6     4/02/99 2:46p Matt
 * Moved flags from deathinfo to deathinfo_external, because the arhive
 * builder only copies the latter into the archive.
 *
 * 5     4/02/99 11:23a Matt
 * Made KillObject not take a death_info struct, but rather the death info
 * as individual parameters.  Moved death_info into objinfo.h, since it's
 * only used for generic objects.  Took out fade-away death hack, now that
 * fade-away deaths can be explicitely set.
