 *
 * 21    10/21/99 1:32p Jeff
 * added checkbox to prevent certain rooms from lighting
 *
 * 20    4/28/99 1:39p Chris
 * Added the ability to block portals
 *
 * 19    4/26/99 11:11a Chris
 * Updated Bnode system
 *
 * 18    4/18/99 5:39a Chris
 * Vastly improved the path node system
 *
 * 17    4/15/99 5:49p Chris
 * Fixed a bug with rendering the BOAPath nodes
 *
 * 16    4/15/99 12:20p Jason
 * made mirrors more robust and able to have multiple mirrored faces in
 * the same room (as long as they are all on the same plane)
 *
 * 15    4/14/99 3:13p Chris
 * Beginning to add BoaNode stuff
 *
 * 14    4/14/99 11:40a Jason
 * added secret flag
 *
 * 13    4/05/99 10:54a Matt
 * Added auto-waypoint system
 *
 * 12    3/31/99 5:14p Matt
 * Added shell flag for faces
 *
 * 11    3/11/99 1:08p Jason
 * more fixes for smooth specular lighting
 *
 * 10    3/01/99 8:10p Matt
 * Added flag for manually-set path points
 *
 * 9     2/21/99 4:35p Chris
 * Improving the level goal system...  Not done.
 *
 * 8     2/19/99 4:26p Jason
 * more work on Katmai support
 *
 * 7     2/09/99 9:59a Chris
 * Massive BOA update  :)  Terrain happy now.  Vis happy now.  Sound happy
 * now.
 *
 * 6     2/03/99 5:49p Matt
 * Added room damage system
 *
 * 5     2/03/99 4:26p Jason
 * made multiplayer coop actually work!
 *
 * 4     2/01/99 4:17p Jason
 * more changes for multisafe
 *
 * 3     1/29/99 12:48p Matt
 * Rewrote the doorway system
 *
 * 2     1/21/99 11:15p Jeff
 * pulled out some structs and defines from header files and moved them
 * into seperate header files so that multiplayer dlls don't require major
 * game headers, just those new headers.  Side effect is a shorter build
 * time.  Also cleaned up some header file #includes that weren't needed.
 * This affected polymodel.h, object.h, player.h, vecmat.h, room.h,
 * manage.h and multi.h
