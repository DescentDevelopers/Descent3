 * Updated the BNode system - vastly improved error checking and verify

 * Knocked MAX_BNODES_PER_ROOM down to 127 after reading the comment about
 * a byte count in the portal struct.

 * 11    5/03/99 12:50a 3dsmax
 * Changed MAX_BNODES_PER_ROOM from 100 to 200 for Luke. (MattT)

 * Added the portal blockage support

 * Changed BNode_FreeRoom() to take a room pointer instead of a room
 * number, since it was being called for rooms in the scrap buffer, which
 * weren't in the room list.  Also added code to InitRoom() to init the
 * bnode data.
