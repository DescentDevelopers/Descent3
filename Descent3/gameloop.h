 * Keep the rear view up between levels, but close the other camera views.
 *
 * 15    4/17/99 6:15p Samir
 * replaced gr.h with grdefs.h and fixed resulting compile bugs.
 *
 * 14    10/21/98 11:14a Samir
 * added generic code to skip rendering while in game controller config or
 * telcom.
 *
 * 13    8/24/98 10:40a Jason
 * fixed some rendering problems
 *
 * 12    3/03/98 12:10p Samir
 * Added simple pausing.
 *
 * 11    2/25/98 2:05p Jason
 * did FOV and object visibility changes
 *
 * 10    2/24/98 2:31p Jason
 * added FOV warp effect for when coming back to life
 *
 * 9     2/18/98 3:25p Samir
 * Added test systems code.
 *
 * 8     2/12/98 6:51p Matt
 * Renamed GameLoop() to be GameFrame(), cleaned up the StartTime/StopTime
 * system, and moved the interval script call to GameFrame().
 *
 * 7     2/09/98 3:54p Matt
 * Added prototype
 *
 * 6     2/04/98 6:09p Matt
 * Changed object room number to indicate a terrain cell via a flag.  Got
 * rid of the object flag which used to indicate terrain.
 *
 * 5     2/04/98 12:50a Matt
 * Added ability to view from a gun point in small views.
 * Made pop-up view separate from and bigger than other small views.
 * Added real keys to set view mode in the three small views.
 * Changed rendering functions a bit to accommodate smallview changes.
 *
 * 4     1/30/98 2:56p Matt
 * Added support for small views.  Made R toggle rear view, and Delete-F8
 * show a view from object 2.  Also changed main window render flow so
 * could share code with small views.
 *
 * 3     1/06/98 1:28p Matt
 * Cleaned up interfaces to rendering routines, deleted unused code, etc.
 *
 * 2     12/29/97 5:44p Samir
 * Took out references to grViewport and old 2d library.
 *
 * 3     5/05/97 4:47p Jason
 * made terrain and mine rendering work without explicit calls to
 * g3_Startframe in their main function calls
 * This allows us to integrate mine/terrain engines nicely
 *
 * 2     2/03/97 8:14p Matt
 * Added gameloop.cpp & gameloop.h
