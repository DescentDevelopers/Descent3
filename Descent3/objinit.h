 * Re-revised the ObjInit() system.  ObjInit() again does all the
 * initialization stuff, but now it's passed a lot more information so
 * those fields can be set before the rest of the initialization takes
 * place.
 *
 * 7     4/10/99 5:56p Matt
 * Cleaned up object initialization code, including create object & load
 * object.
 *
 * 6     3/30/98 6:58p Matt
 * When reinitializing an object, don't bash its custom script.
 *
 * 5     3/30/98 6:20p Matt
 * Renamed ResetObject() to be ObjReInitAll()
 *
 * 4     1/18/98 9:06p Matt
 * Changed a comment, and deleted some unused code
 *
 * 3     8/21/97 5:56p Samir
 * Took out script specific stuff from ObjInit and moved to ObjScript
 *
 * 2     8/12/97 3:25p Samir
 * Added prototype to initialize scripts for objects.
 *
 * 2     4/04/97 2:57p Matt
 * Added code to initialize all the type-specific data for an object from
 * the page for that object type.  This means that we need to pass less
 * info to ObjCreate(), and that we save less info in the level save file.
 * It also makes it easy to reset all the objects when an object page has
 * changed.
