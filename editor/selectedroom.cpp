 * Functions for dealing with selected list

 * 10    4/16/99 5:18p Matt
 * Don't free selected list memory if none was allocated.
 * 
 * 9     4/11/99 2:41a Jeff
 * had to include stdafx.h for neweditor
 * 
 * 8     4/07/99 7:07p Gwar
 * added #define NEWEDITOR checks
 * 
 * 7     1/21/99 11:15p Jeff
 * pulled out some structs and defines from header files and moved them
 * into seperate header files so that multiplayer dlls don't require major
 * game headers, just those new headers.  Side effect is a shorter build
 * time.  Also cleaned up some header file #includes that weren't needed.
 * This affected polymodel.h, object.h, player.h, vecmat.h, room.h,
 * manage.h and multi.h
 * 
 * 6     10/08/98 4:24p Kevin
 * Changed code to comply with memory library usage. Always use mem_malloc
 * , mem_free and mem_strdup
 * 
 * 5     12/23/97 1:33p Samir
 * Added pserror.h
 * 
 * 4     9/04/97 4:39p Matt
 * Added includes needed as a result of removing includes from d3edit.h
 * 
 * 3     8/29/97 5:26p Matt
 * Fixed name of  ClearRoomSelectedList()
 * 
 * 2     7/31/97 3:31p Jason
 * added functions to rotate portal rooms
 *
