 * $Author: kevinb $
 *
 * Editor object handling functions
 *
 * $Log: not supported by cvs2svn $
 * 
 * 41    4/18/99 5:42a Chris
 * Added the FQ_IGNORE_RENDER_THROUGH_PORTALS flag
 * 
 * 40    3/27/99 12:51p Chris
 * The editor object placement code now allows objects to be pushed into
 * wall (when a toggle box is checked)
 * 
 * 39    1/15/99 7:52p Chris
 * Updated ObjSetPos() to include a f_update_attach_children flag
 * 
 * 38    10/15/98 3:26p Chris
 * Fixed known ground plane issues and used PhysCalcGround everywhere
 * 
 * 37    10/07/98 12:28p Matt
 * Fixed stupid bug that could cause access violation placing objects on
 * the terrain.
 * 
 * 36    8/24/98 2:20p Matt
 * Fixed bug placing objects on external rooms.
 * 
 * 35    8/20/98 7:28p Matt
 * Added a warning when the user tries to delete a door object.
 * 
 * 34    6/17/98 12:30p Samir
 * don't draw wireframe when moving an object.
 * 
 * 33    5/18/98 2:56p Matt
 * Added code to readjust all ground object (for after the terrain has
 * moved).
 * 
 * 32    5/11/98 11:37a Sean

 * 
 * 28    2/20/98 5:30p Matt
 * Don't allow physics objects to be placed if they collide with walls,
 * and don't allow them to move into walls.  Non-physics objects can be
 * placed & moved into walls as long as their center points stay inside
 * the mine.
 * 
 * 27    2/13/98 6:50p Matt
 * Fixed stupid bug that prevented placing of player ship 0

 * Fixed problem placing an object on the terrain.
 * 
 * 20    2/04/98 6:23p Matt
 * Changed object room number to indicate a terrain cell via a flag.  Got
 * rid of the object flag which used to indicate terrain.
 * 
 * 19    1/07/98 6:39p Jason
 * Fixed player object number stuff
 * 
 * 18    1/07/98 10:45a Samir

 * 
 * 10    8/20/97 4:23p Matt
 * Fixed little bug
 * 
 * 9     8/12/97 10:24p Matt

 * 
 * 8     8/11/97 1:53p Matt
 * Ripped out robot & powerup pages, and added generic page
 * 
 * 7     8/04/97 3:18p Matt
 * Added FVI checking to object placement & movement in rooms
 * 
 * 6     8/04/97 12:47p Matt
 * Added object placement & movement for rooms
 * 
 * 5     8/01/97 5:33p Jason

 * and changing a few others
 * 
 * 3     7/17/97 4:34p Chris

 * Added Flip and SetDefault Object functions.
 * 
 * 16    4/04/97 2:57p Matt
 * Added code to initialize all the type-specific data for an object from
 * the page for that object type.  This means that we need to pass less
 * info to ObjCreate(), and that we save less info in the level save file.
 * It also makes it easy to reset all the objects when an object page has
 * changed.
 * 
 * 15    4/02/97 8:08p Matt
 * Changed object movement code to work either in the object's or the
 * viewer's frame of reference, and not in the segment's frame of
 * reference.

 * 
 * 5     3/03/97 5:57a Chris

 * call.
 * 
 * 4     2/19/97 3:37p Samir
 * Added delete and rotation of objects.
 * 
 * 3     2/17/97 7:19p Jason
