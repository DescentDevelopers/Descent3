 * For fullscreen game from editor, hide all user interface elements of

 * fullscreen.  Old method of blanking window doesn't work.
 *
 * 19    10/16/97 4:41p Samir

 *
 * 11    8/01/97 11:59a Samir
 * Added a preference for debugging in fullscreen.
 *
 * 10    7/25/97 12:02p Samir

 * graphics system for running the game.
 *
 * 9     7/24/97 6:34p Jeff
 * Turned on mouse by default
 *
 * 8     7/22/97 7:07p Matt

 *
 * 36    6/09/97 4:15p Samir
 * Hide cursor while in game.
 *
 * 35    5/29/97 3:25p Chris
 *
 * 34    5/27/97 7:23p Matt
 * Fixed (hopefully for real this time) the same problem I tried to fix
 * last time.
 *
 * 33    5/27/97 5:41p Jason
 * added toggling of opengl renderer
 *
 * 32    5/27/97 5:22p Matt
 * Fixed editor->game->editor code to save & load gamesave.d3l in same
 * directory.
 *
 * 31    5/27/97 4:39p Jason
 * changes to support OpenGL
 *
 * 30    5/22/97 4:03p Samir
 * HACK!  Assigned hOpenGLWnd.
 *
 * 29    5/16/97 3:40p Matt
 * When going from game->editor, only copy player to viewer if the levels
 * are the same, which we determine by checking the mission name & level
 * number (though I think it would be better to check the filename.)
 *
 * 28    5/15/97 5:14p Matt
 * When going from game to editor, set terrain/mine editing based on where
 * the player is
 *
 * 27    5/15/97 3:20p Samir
 * Fixed problem with editor being show during gameplay.
 *
 * 26    5/15/97 2:07p Samir

 *
 * 25    5/15/97 1:59a Chris
 *
 * 24    5/06/97 4:11p Matt
 * Fixed a bunch of code that deals with the player and viewer objects
 * when going between the game and editor.
 *
 * 23    5/06/97 1:17p Jason
 * checked in for matt
 *
 * 22    5/01/97 6:08p Matt
 * When switching between editor & game, save & load level to temp file.
 *
 * 21    4/24/97 1:33p Chris
 * Sound initializations are all now editor friendly.  Fullscreen,
 * windowed, and editor.
 *
 * 20    4/23/97 6:06p Jason
 * made player ship and weapons work correctly together (first pass)
 *
 * 19    4/03/97 8:37p Chris
 * Added the Main_OS object pass in the sound library
 * initialization code.
 *
 * 18    4/03/97 5:45p Jason
 * make player/viewer object switch flags if over terrain
 *
 * 17    4/01/97 11:00p Matt
 * Changed editor to keep a viewer object (type camera) separate from the
 * player object.  This camera, and not the player, is now moved by
 * slewing, the C key, etc.  When going into the game, the viewer position
 * & orientation are copied to the player.  When going back to the editor,
 * the player position is copied to the viewer, and the player object is
 * reset to its start location.
 *
 * 16    3/31/97 1:23p Samir
 * Fixed problem when going to fullscreen mode when last mode was GDI,
 * which then caused a crash.  Fixed this by moving graphics and sound
 * initialization to after new window is created and processed.
 *
 * 15    3/28/97 11:46a Chris
 * Make sound code use editor's window handle
 *
 * 14    3/27/97 10:48a Chris
 * Removed some bad code
 *
 * 13    3/17/97 5:12p Chris
 * Allowed new sound code to be demo'ed.
 *
 * 12    3/17/97 11:54a Chris
 * Forced a valid mass and drag (hack).  But, I did use chrishack so I
 * will remove it later.  This fixes the problem with imported D2 levels
 * have invalid player data.
 *
 * 11    3/12/97 6:31p Chris
 * Added player flight controls while in game
 *
 * 10    2/28/97 11:03a Samir
 * Changes to reflect newer gameos interface.
 *
 * 9     2/11/97 3:48p Samir
 * Added ddio.h
 *
 * 8     2/11/97 2:45p Samir
 * flushed keyboard when entering or leaving game from editor.
 *
 * 7     2/05/97 12:17p Samir
 * Set window size for both fullscreen and windowed versions.
 *
 * 6     2/04/97 6:23p Samir
 * Don't make windowed game window topmost.
 *
 * 5     2/04/97 5:33p Samir

 *

 *
 * 3     1/30/97 6:43p Samir
 * stupid forgetting an argument
 *

 * New gameos.h implementation
