 * Changed editor to keep a viewer object (type camera) seperate from the
 * player object.  This camera, and not the player, is now moved by
 * slewing, the C key, etc.  When going into the game, the viewer position
 * & orientation are copied to the player.  When going back to the editor,
 * the player position is copied to the viewer, and the player object is
 * reset to its start location.
